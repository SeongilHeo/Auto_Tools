I never see this album without recollecting my happy school life.
I will give you an answer after consulting my father.
He is above telling a lie.
A toothbrush is used for cleaning our teeth.
I was wrong in allowing my son to go climbing.
We made a mistake in choosing him.
He insists on paying.
He persists in denying knowledge of it.
I am fond of travelling alone.
I am tired of looking for a job.
