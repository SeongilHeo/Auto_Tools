I don't like being pitied.
I intend to see the king.
Your shoes want mending.
The pains are past bearing.
He denies having stolen the watch.
I repent having been idle.
I cannot fancy him doing such a thing.
Fancy being confined in a horrible dungeon!
We cannot help sympathizing with the sufferers.
They burst out laughing.
